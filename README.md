# Boilerplate - MV

Minimalistic client-side Model/View boilerplate using Handlebars templates,
jQuery AJAX and selector engine, Underscore utilities. For situations where an MV
pattern is useful/necessary but an existing framework or technique can not be used.

**Before choosing to use this boilerplate consider these options:**

* [Use an existing MV framework](documents/popular-frameworks.md)
* [Use plain JS with limited library support](documents/jquery-underscore-mv.md)

## Use Boilerplate MV

### Overview
Use Model/Collection, View, and Router base classes to configure client-side MV
framework for interactive components and applications. This is not a replacement
for existing popular framework, rather it is a limited-dependency standalone solution
that is portable to other frameworks. The class system, naming conventions, and
methods share similarities with popular libraries/frameworks/utilities.
