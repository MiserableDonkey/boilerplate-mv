## Use an existing MV framework instead of this boilerplate

Anything from standalone web page components to fully-packaged client-side applications
can use an MV pattern or framework. Separating code between model data and view
markup is good practice in general and should not necessarily be considered additional
effort.

Both Backbone and Angular can be scaled for very simple and highly complex projects.
With simple implementations Backbone and Angular can be relied on for low learning
curb and comprehensive documentation. The model/view programming pattern conventions
used in both frameworks is easily recognizable.
